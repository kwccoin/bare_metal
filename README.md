# bare metal programming and network towards a philosophy of some kind

## 1. Objectives

*  This is a start to study from scratch different 1 (x86 and ARM mainly, perhaps some S360) and later on network (of 2 - just 2, 2 cooperate, 2 non-cooperate, ... with some links; then the idea of many)

1. OS Part (x86)

  * little book of OS rely upon 
    * https://littleosbook.github.io/#introduction 
    * GRUB, 
    * x86 assembly (NASM)
    * elf
    * 16->32 bit
    * C and assembly
    * 
  * mikeos rely upon
    * http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/ 
    * no GRUB, self loader
    * x86 assembly (NASM)
    * 16 bit only!
    * BIOS a lot 
    * flat binary
    * 
  * brokenhorn is 16->32 bit, assembly and flat binary
    * http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html
    * no GRUB, self loader 
    * x86 assembly (NASM)
    * flat binary
    * BIOS first then 32 bit on one's own
    * VC is involved later
    * 
  * linux 0.11
    * https://gitlab.com/tinylab/linux-0.11
    * http://tinylab.org/linux-0.11-lab/
    * http://tinylab.org/take-5-minutes-to-build-linux-0-11-experiment-envrionment/
    * http://www.oldlinux.org/download/clk011c-3.0.pdf
    * http://www.oldlinux.org/
    * 

2. OS Part (ARM)

  * Cambridge
    * https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/
    * ARM fixed loader (due to use of GPU setup routine)
    * old PI only (may try to update it as valvur do)
    * rely upon 3rd party USB
    * binary
    * elf
    * cross tool chain
    * 
  * valver
    * http://www.valvers.com/open-software/raspberry-pi/step01-bare-metal-programming-in-cpt1/
    * as using ARM it use ARM fixed loader
    * cover new Pi2 and old Pi
    * Mainly C with C-ARM assemby
    * 
  * GBA
    * http://wiki.osdev.org/GameBoy_Advance_Barebones
    * http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm
    * http://www.loirak.com/gameboy/
    * 
  * in general
    * http://wiki.osdev.org/Tutorials
    * http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones
    * http://wiki.osdev.org/Babystep1
    * 

3. network bit 
  * SNA vs TCP/IP (well vs TV, Radio, fire, smoke ...)
  * Within TCP/IP use 
  * trying
    * self network
    * self wireless network
    * public network
    * just users of network
  * what network really is ...

N. P part

  * If you wonder The P part is mainly related to the study of a P of one (Descates tradition ...), the network-is-computer kind (Hegel kind ...) and there-is-no-one (Marxist per Althusser kind)
  * It will touch upon also how things evolves over time (based on computer and network) plus 
  * Human as species will be gone one day ... as said what is left in "education" is what is left after all is forgetten.  What is left of human species (as all species die, one day human will either evolve or just extinct).  
  * Chinese P 
  * Western P of various kinds
  * Communism not dying around here and seems still a driving force behind and hence ...
  * software bit (DNA, gene, ...) as a kind 
  * network bit 
  * histroy bit 

## The key is how the experiement and history of IT illumuate all these, stay tuned
